They are just some little console programs that demonstrate how works the economy framework .\r\n\r\nExperimental\r\n\r\n( Included is an initial AI FSM based on http://www.ai-junkie.com/architecture/state_driven/tut_state1.html , that will serve to implement the Governor class , that will manage bases and their associated factories . )\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n\r\nAbout paths for the solution/project :\r\n\r\nI use this $(HOME_DEFG) to define the root of the API for your convenience . So you just have to define environment variable in windows to be able to compile and link.\r\n\r\nExemple : On my system , HOME_DEFG = C:/YOUR_LOCAL_REPO/DEFG Or you can manually set the header and lib locations .\r\n\r\nDependencies are :\r\n\r\n_Boost 1_45 for windows ( NOT INCLUDED ) ( I use the version from vegastrike folder from svn ... ) _xmlparse.lib ( INCLUDED )","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
