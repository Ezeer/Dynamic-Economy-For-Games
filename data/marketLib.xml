While larger and not as nimble as fighters or interceptors, the Areus is perfectly well equipped to engage any smaller craft foolish enough to wander near its gun sights. Armament on the Areus isn&apos;t well suited to assaulting capital vessels directly, but is entirely sufficient for destroying subcapitals, support craft, or softening up craft too large to destroy outright with the limited payload available.

      <Column5>A bejeweled sword among more workmanlike interceptors since its introduction three years ago, the Highborn Gawain is an impressively featured and stylish craft.  Magnificently built, it offers an array of features: a number of gun mounts, missile room, and a powerful engine capable of firm acceleration.  It also offers a number of luxuries to the pilot as well, and those that have flown the Gawain consider it an experience to which little can compare.  Like all Highborn vessels, it is known for its durability and reliability even under the worst conditions.  Its features come at a great price, however, and it is one that few can afford.  Perhaps for this reason, there are relatively few Gawains in service, with some buyers opting to requisition several of the much-cheaper Derivative class interceptors instead.</Column5>

      <Column5>The luddites, being by their nature not given to grand industrialization, rely on a small number of hidden facilities and sympathetic manufacturing plants to supply them with ships. The Redeemer bears the distinction of being the only class of spacecraft officially sanctioned by the reverend Sverde, who, when presented with its initial designs 45 years ago, said that prayer had revealed to her that that this was to be the &apos;shepherds crook&apos; by which man&apos;s sins would be constrained. Inexpensive, even at the time of its introduction, the Redeemer remains a utilitarian craft well suited to the production schedules of backwater worlds.</Column5>

An aging fighter design, the improvements that the Robin has seen over the years have been largely incremental, focusing on small improvements rather than large overhauls.  Due to the relatively limited resource of the LIHW compared to other constituents of the Confederation, most of the improvements have been in the way of reliability.  Because of this, the Robin is known as an inexpensive vessel that rarely breaks down, and perhaps due to this, it is a common sight in the human-controlled regions of space.</Column5>

      <Column5>@upgrades/beam1.image@The canonical example of shield-based weaponry, the disruptor beam is highly effective at disrupting the twisted maze of forces created by a shield generator, but entirely unequipped to trickle damage past a shield until the shield in question has already nearly faltered. Disruptors, just like the shields they share most of their technological lineage with, interact violently with matter, making them poorly suited to use outside of vacuum. Fortunately for those on the receiving end of a disruptor blast, even a shield de-patterned to the point of collapse will mitigate a disruptor&apos;s effects on materials beyond the shield. Unfortunately for those on the receiving end of a disruptor, mitigate is not the same as eliminate. Those unfortunate enough to receive disruptor fire with no shield generator at all are usually at least fortunate enough that the shear forces kill them before they can notice. This design is exceptionally popular among adherents to the trekkie religion, but its reliability and effectiveness make it nothing to scoff at.</Column5>

Most effective against light and medium ships. They are best used in salvos rather than individually. One missile often will weaken the target&apos;s defenses enough to let the others get through and do damage to the ship itself.

PAIs tend to be able to present more natural user interfaces than the expert systems they compete with, tending to be at least vaguely self-aware, and much more responsive to and on emotional levels. In particular, niche market and custom built models are limited only by legislation requiring that entities surpassing a specified set of standardized metrics cannot be considered property, and must be registered as either custom children or custom dependent employees.
